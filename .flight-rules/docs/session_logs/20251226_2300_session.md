## Session Goals

- Define the PRD for r9stack

## Related Specs

- N/A (initial project setup - no implementation specs yet)

## Summary

Defined the initial PRD for r9stack, an opinionated SaaS boilerplate that provides a fully functional walking skeleton. Established the tech stack (TanStack Start, Convex, WorkOS, Stripe, shadcn/ui) and scoped the v1 walking skeleton features. Created README and Apache 2.0 LICENSE.

## Implementation Details

This session focuses on documentation, not code. We're defining what r9stack will be.

## Key Decisions

**Tech Stack (opinionated, v1):**
- Frontend: React via TanStack Start
- Backend: Convex
- Database: Convex (built-in)
- Auth: WorkOS (integrated with Convex)
- Payments: Stripe
- Styling: shadcn/ui (Tailwind-based)
- Hosting: TBD

**Walking Skeleton v1 scope:**
- User authentication (WorkOS + Convex)
- Basic application shell/layout
- Database models only as needed for skeleton
- NO CI/CD pipeline in v1 (future enhancement)

## Challenges & Solutions

No significant challenges - this was a documentation session.

## Code Areas Touched

- `.flight-rules/docs/prd.md`
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`

## Spec Updates Needed

- [ ] Create initial implementation areas after PRD is finalized

## Next Steps

- Define implementation areas and task groups
- Begin building the walking skeleton

## Learnings

- When describing a boilerplate/scaffold project, ensure all layers of the stack are given equal prominence rather than overemphasizing specific integrations like auth or payments.
