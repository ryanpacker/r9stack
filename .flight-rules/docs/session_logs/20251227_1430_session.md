# Session Log: 2025-12-27 14:30

## Session Goals

- Revise the PRD to pivot from "clone a repo" approach to a CLI-based scaffolding tool
- Update README.md to reflect the new CLI approach

## Related Specs

- N/A (PRD-focused session - no implementation specs yet)

## Summary

Pivoted r9stack from a "clone this repo" boilerplate to a CLI tool that scaffolds new projects. This mirrors the approach used by [flight-rules](https://github.com/ryanpacker/flight-rules). The tech stack for generated projects remains unchanged (TanStack Start, Convex, WorkOS, Stripe, shadcn/ui), but the CLI itself will be built with TypeScript following the flight-rules pattern.

## Implementation Details

This session focused on documentation changes, not code implementation.

**PRD Changes:**
- Rewrote Overview to describe CLI tool instead of repo cloning
- Updated Goals to include clear setup guidance for manual steps
- Added new "Tech Stack" section distinguishing CLI tool (TypeScript) from generated project
- Added "CLI Commands (v1)" section documenting `r9stack init`
- Updated User Stories to reflect CLI experience and include story about setup instructions
- Renamed "Walking Skeleton Features" to "Generated Project Features"
- Added constraint about manual setup requirements
- Updated Success Criteria to reference running a command and providing clear instructions

**README Changes:**
- Updated description to "CLI tool that scaffolds"
- Changed "Clone the repo" to "Run a single command"
- Updated Features section to clarify these are generated project features
- Replaced placeholder Getting Started with CLI installation/usage

## Key Decisions

1. **CLI approach over clone** – More scalable, easier upgrades, cleaner user experience
2. **TypeScript for CLI** – Matches flight-rules pattern, good tooling support
3. **Clear instructions requirement** – CLI must provide links and guidance for manual setup steps (WorkOS account, Convex project, Stripe keys)
4. **Focus on `init` for v1** – Other commands (upgrade, etc.) deferred to future versions

## Challenges & Solutions

No significant challenges - this was a documentation session.

## Code Areas Touched

- `.flight-rules/docs/prd.md`
- `README.md`

## Spec Updates Needed

- [ ] Create initial implementation areas after PRD is finalized

## Next Steps

- Define implementation areas and task groups for the CLI
- Begin building the CLI scaffolding tool

## Learnings

- When pivoting a project's delivery mechanism (repo clone → CLI), ensure all user-facing documentation (README, getting started) is updated to match the new mental model
