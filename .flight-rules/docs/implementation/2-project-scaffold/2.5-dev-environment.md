# 2.5 Dev Environment

## Overview

Set up the development environment configuration, scripts, and documentation that helps users get started quickly. Most of this is r9stack-provided content that builds on what the CLIs create.

## What Comes From CLIs vs r9stack

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Base package.json scripts | TanStack Start CLI |
| Convex dev script | Convex CLI |
| Combined dev workflow | r9stack (merges both) |
| Environment templates | r9stack |
| Service setup instructions | r9stack |
| Project README | r9stack |

## Task Group Goals

- Provide clear scripts for development workflow
