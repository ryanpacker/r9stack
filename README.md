# r9stack

An opinionated SaaS boilerplate that provides a fully functional walking skeleton—a complete frontend, backend, and database stack with auth and payments pre-integrated.

## Why r9stack?

Agentic coding has dramatically accelerated feature development, but initial project setup—configuring the frontend framework, wiring up the backend and database, integrating auth providers, setting up payments—remains tedious and error-prone.

r9stack eliminates this friction. Clone the repo and have a working full-stack app in minutes.
