# Tech Stack

This document describes the technical environment for this project. It serves as a reference for humans and agents when performing tech-dependent tasks.

---

## Testing

<!-- 
This section is the primary focus. Document your testing setup so that agents
can create appropriate tests without requiring you to re-explain the framework.

Use the `/test.assess-current` command to auto-populate this section.
-->

### Framework

<!-- 
What testing framework does this project use?
Examples: Vitest, Jest, pytest, RSpec, Go testing, etc.
-->

### Test Location & Naming

<!-- 
Where do test files live? What naming conventions are used?

Examples:
- Tests live in `tests/` directory, mirroring `src/` structure
- Test files named `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Co-located with source files as `ComponentName.test.tsx`
-->

### Running Tests

<!-- 
What commands are used to run tests?

Examples:
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - With coverage report
-->

### Patterns & Conventions

<!-- 
What patterns does this project follow for writing tests?

Consider documenting:
- Assertion style (expect, assert, should)
- Mocking approach (vi.mock, jest.mock, unittest.mock)
- Test organization (describe/it blocks, test classes)
- Fixtures or factories used
- Any custom test utilities
-->

### Example Test Structure

<!-- 
Provide a representative example of how tests are structured in this project.
This helps agents match the existing style.

```typescript
// Example test structure goes here
```

## Runtime & Language

<!-- 
Brief notes on the runtime environment.
Examples: Node.js 20, Python 3.11, Go 1.21
-->

---

## Build Tools

<!-- 
Brief notes on build/bundling tools if relevant.
Examples: TypeScript + tsup, Vite, webpack, esbuild
-->

---

## Key Dependencies

<!-- 
List major frameworks or libraries that define the project's architecture.
Not an exhaustive list—just the ones that matter for understanding the codebase.

Examples:
- React 18 with React Router
- Express.js for API
- Prisma for database access
